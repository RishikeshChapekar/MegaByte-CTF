Browsing through old and "jumbled" stuff in the attic of your great grandparents' home, you find a little battery-operated machine.
It has two rectangular holes with a small paper scrap jutting out of one hole.
The paper reads "bVcdMXcYXMfWE3GW2jW33QJZcN5gN5RI=D7xonzfkoz=". 
Did Grandpa leave a secret message for you?
