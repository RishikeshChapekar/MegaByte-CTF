# MegaByte-CTF
This is the Capture The Flag competition created by the MegaByteCrew, a group of students. In order to play you must join our discord server (invite link will be provided shortly).

## How To Play 
In this Git repository, you will find puzzles categorised based on their level of difficulty. Use any method you see fit to solve the puzzle and get the flag which is a text of the format `mbCTF{...}` . Once you have this flag, you can submit it to the MegaByte CTF bot on our discord server. The bot will award you points for each puzzle that you correctly solve.The challenges require you to use your skills of exploitation, encryption etc. to get to the flag. 

## Basic Rules

1. Do not abuse the bot. Such actions will result in immediate ban from this CTF as well as all future CTFs
2. Do not share answers or discuss how to solve challenges in the discord channels. This will result in strict action against all parties involved
3. Do not unnecessarily disturb the moderators. Post your concerns in the channel provided for this very purpose. A moderator will attent to your doubts ASAP. 
4. Do not spam the troubleshooting channel. Ask a doubt once and be patient, someone will get to you. If they don't respond within 24 hours, then you may repost the doubt
5. Play fair
6. You are free to use any resources available online to help you with the challenges
7. Do noy post answers anywhere on any online forum,social media,etc

## Game Rules
