In this Git repository, you will find puzzles categorised based on their level of difficulty. Use any method you see fit to solve the puzzle and get the flag which is a text of the format `mbCTF{...}` . Once you have this flag, you can submit it to the MegaByte CTF bot on our discord server. The bot will award you points for each puzzle that you correctly solve.The challenges require you to use your skills of exploitation, encryption etc. to get to the flag. 

## Basic Rules

  2. The puzzle file. This will contain your actual puzzle,which,when solved, will grant the player the flag. Should also be in English.
4. If your puzzle contains more than one file, create a sub folder within the level folder and name it as the puzzle number. Put all the puzzle files in there. 
5. Once you have done a pull request, email the flags (in a text file. One text file per flag) to the developer to be used by the bot when the player plays that particular puzzle. DO NOT DM THE DEVS ON DISCORD
